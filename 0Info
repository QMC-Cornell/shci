!Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.
git fetch upstream

!Check out your fork's local master branch.
git checkout master

!Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.
git merge upstream/master
